   Please do not use macopt without understanding a little about how it works;
   there are some control parameters which the user MUST set!

   David MacKay's optimizer, based on conjugate gradient ideas, 
   but using bracketing of the zero of the inner product 

             (gradient).(line_search_direction)

   to do the line minimization. Only derivative calculations are required.
   The length of the first step in the line search (often set to "1.0"
   in other code) is adapted here so that, if 0.00001 is a better step size, 
   it soon cottons on to that and saves ~log(10000) bracketing operations.
   The result is that (with rich set to 0) the program can use 
   as few as 2 derivatives per line search. (If rich is set to 1, it does 
   an extra derivative calculation at the beginning of each line search 
   making a minimum of 3 per line search. Set rich=0 if you think 
   that the surface is locally quite quadratic.) If the program does average 
   2 derivatives per line search then it must be superior to most cg methods 
   including use of Rbackprop (which costs 2 derivatives straight off)

   A possible modification: where the function can be returned at same 
   time as the dfunction --- there is nothing clever to do with the 
   value, but it could be used as a sanity check and a convergence criterion. 

   See http://131.111.48.24/mackay/c/macopt.html for further discussion.

   NB: The value of "tol" is totally arbitrary and must be set by 
   you to a value that works well for your problem. 
   It depends completely on the typical value of the gradient / step size. 

   Tol specifies a magnitude of gradient at which a halt is called. 
   or a step size.

   This program MINIMIZES a function.

 does then I guess a_rich should be 1.

 If the overrun is because too big a step was taken then
 the interpolation should be made between zero and the most 
 recent measurement. 

 If the overrun is because too small a step was taken then 
 the best place to go is the most distant point. 
 I will assume that this doesn't happen for the moment.

 Also need to check up what happens to t and s in the case of overrun.
 And gx and gy. 

 Maybe sort this out when writing a macopt that makes use of the gradient
